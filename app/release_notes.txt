Version 3.3
===========
Released June 16, 2014

- New detection algorithms:

    - Added a new algorithm "X Step w/ Interp". This uses cubic splines to interpolate over data such as dotted/dashed lines and even data points. A smoothing parameter is also provided that controls the width in x-direction that the underlying detection is averaged over. A parameter value of 0 turns off this smoothing. Any value higher than zero will add some smoothing over the data.

    - Added a blob detection algorithm. This allows detecting locating the centers of objects ("blobs") in an image. This also calculates the area and the first rotational invariant image moment of each blob. The Min_Distance and Max_Distance parameters help excluding objects that are smaller or larger than this range.

- UI Tweaks:
    - Visual busy indication when loading an image or when auto extract algorithm is running.
    - Box mask drawing tool improved.
    - Minor tweaks to improve usability on smaller screens.


Version 3.2
===========
Released May 27, 2014

- Color picker for FG and BG color also show a list of dominant colors in the image.
    - This makes it more convenient to select plots.
    - In the future, the underlying algorithm will help improve automatic extraction.

- Bug fixes: The following issues have been fixed:
    - Under some screen resolutions, Firefox on Windows 7, would not show the zoom view or the sidebar buttons.
    - Clicking "Run" for auto detect without making a mask would throw an error in the javascript console.
        - Now, the entire image will be used by default if no mask is drawn.


Version 3.1
===========
Released: May 14, 2014

- Prevent browsers from caching HTML page of the app.


Version 3.0
===========
Released: May 11, 2014

A complete overhaul of the app was required to introduce some of the new features and improve maintainability.

Plot display:
    - Added ability to zoom in/out an image
    - Graphics widget can now handle relatively larger images

Zoom view:
    - Larger zoom view
    - Added ability to adjust magnification
    - Added ability to change crosshair color

Axes alignment:
    - Added ability to adjust points using keyboard keys. Pressing shift along with cursor keys moves the points faster.
    - Added labels for points which persist when alignment values are entered.
    - Unit can be defined for map axes. This is useful when making distance measurements.

Manual data acquisition:
    - Points can now be adjusted using keyboard cursor keys

Automatic data acquisition:
    - New mask display and color selection views improve overall detection accuracy.
    - Improved workflow eliminates the need for the popup window for fine tuning. These controls are now available from the sidebar itself.

Data table:
    - Digitized data can now be exported to a CSV file without the user having to copy-paste values.

Measurements:
    - Added ability to measure distances and angles in images. For map axes, the distances are calculated in the specified units.

Scripts:
    - Added preliminary support to allow custom user scripts

Webcam support:
    - Added webcam image capture ability (works only in Google Chrome or Firefox)

Image Editing:
    - Image editing functions (flip, crop etc.) have been temporarily hidden. These will be added back in the future releases.

Detection algorithms:
    - Only averaging window and X step are enabled in this version. Other algorithms will be included in a future release.

Code improvements:
    - New modular code structure improves maintainability and ease of adding new features
    - Noticeable performance improvements in many areas
    - More efficient use of memory

UI improvements:
    - Added button highlighting, cleaner stylesheets


Version 2.6
===========
Released: October 20, 2013

Handling Digitized Data:
	- Added option to graph or analyze data in Plot.ly (http://plot.ly)
	- Added options to sort data by ascending or descending order of variables
	- Added option to sort data by nearest neighboring data point. This is useful for things like sketches and outlines.

Automatic Data Extraction:
	- Added algorithm (only for XY plots) which allows user to control the X points at which the data is to be digitized. This is useful for digitizing and comparing values from two curves in the same plot (for example).

Support for Dates:
	- Dates can be entered for XY plots. While calibration, dates have to be entered in yyyy/mm or yyyy/mm/dd format. The output can be formatted in a variety of formats. Support for time is under consideration for next release.

Code improvements:
	- Several improvements in the javascript code were made to ensure WPD continues to work with new browsers.
	- Entire javascript is minified using the Closure compiler. This results in a significantly faster loading time for the app.
	- Minor performance improvements.
	- Minor clean up of the interface.

Browser Support:
	- WPD works in Internet Explorer 10 now.
	- Clipboard copy-paste works for Google Chrome.
